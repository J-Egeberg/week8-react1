#React day2 - create-react-app
##Babel
- Babel is a JavaScript transpiler.  

- Babel has support for the latest version of JavaScript through syntax transformers. These plugins allow you to use new syntax, right now without waiting for browser support.

- [Try it out in jsbin](https://jsbin.com/segovevafu/1/edit?html,js,console,output)

- or like this:  (Use ES6 and JSX in normal script - transpilation will happen on every load. Meaning "Slow")

  ```html
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.14.0/react.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.14.0/react-dom.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-core/5.8.23/browser.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/babel">

  ```


####Classes, imports and exports

React Component module as a class: (basic template)

```react
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import './MyApp.css';

class Container extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {};
        this.myMethod = this.myMethod.bind(this);

    }

    myMethod(id) {

    }

    render() //render method is run when the internal component state has changed.
    {
        return (<div>

        </div>);
    }
}
export default Container;
```

module as a mere function

```javascript
export default function(value, decimalPosition = 2) {
    return '$' + value
            .toFixed(decimalPosition)
            .replace(/(\d)(?=(\d{3})+\.)/g, '$1,')
}
```

used as:

```javascript
import currency from "../Currency";
...
<td>{currency(car.price)}</td>
```

#### Small exercise

<img align="right" src="../img/hammer.jpg" /> 
- Create a es6 class that can return the date and time on the click of a button
- Export the module/class
- Use the model in a script.js file and link to this file from an index.html file
- Run the index file and test that it is working.





##Create-React-App
[**Use this comprehensive Tutorial here**](https://medium.com/@diamondgfx/learning-react-with-create-react-app-part-1-a12e1833fdc#.afqy5jr7d)  
This start project has quickly become very popular. Read about it [here](http://andrewhfarmer.com/create-react-app/)
[Create-React-App on github](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app#getting-started).  
Lets install, create and examine the react project.  
1. Open git bash and run:    

   `npm install â€“g create-react-app` Only first time! Then in your chosen location:  

   `create-react-app <app-name-here>` and  

   `cd <app-name>` to get inside and  

   `npm start` to start your new React application at  
2. Open browser at **http://localhost:3000**  

what can we see in the browsers source view?  
What files can we see in the project folders?

7. Open the App.js and make some changes
8. Run the server to see the result

#### Exercise

<img align="right" src="../img/hammer.jpg" /> 

- Create new create-react-app
- Create 3 files for 3 ES6 classes that are react components.
  - First file is the containing component that renders the 2 others (use the **basic template** in this slide. The containing component also provides the state and the methods to change it.
  -  2 more files can be stateless components
    - first component provides an input field with an onChange attribute
    - second component shows changes made in the input (by the user) and displays them in a div
      - Hint: Let the onChange function in the subcomponent call a changeView function in the containing component. changeView() changes its state -> causing a rerender -> new prop value (from the state) will be re-rendered.
